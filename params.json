{"name":"Noiselib","tagline":"An implementation of libnoise in Go","body":"### Noiselib.\r\nNoiselib is a re-implementation of libnoise in Go. As with libnoise, this library generates coherent noise. This library can generate Perlin, Ridged Multifractal, Billow, and other types of noise.\r\n\r\nAs with libnoise, all noise modules can be chained together to create more complex or natural looking noise output. All noise are interfaces of type Module. Thus a module such as Add (which adds two noise sources together) will accept any other Module, be it Perlin or another Add module.\r\n\r\nUnlike libnoise, batteries are included, and you are able to create terrain maps within the library. These useful utilities will be shown more in the tutorials that are to come.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
